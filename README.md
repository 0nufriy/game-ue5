1)  The technology is a PC;

2)  mechanics - a spacecraft survival simulator;

3)  History is a criminal;

4)  Aesthetics - Sci-fi.

## Introduction

Space pirates get into another adventure, during which their ship is
damaged and begins to fall apart every second. They need to reach the
final point before the spaceship is left with only the ceiling, either
by teaming up with the team or taking matters into their own hands.
Monitor the condition of the ship, repair what can be repaired, and
fight off the invaders.

## Target audience

The main audience for this game is people aged 12 to 27. First of all,
the game will be interesting for team players or people who like to play
with family or friends. The game can also attract people who like
dynamic gameplay with fast decision-making.

## Unique selling proposition

- Break through space in an attempt to escape from the space federation
  on a ship that is falling apart every moment!

- Gather a team of specialists in a split-screen cooperative and
  organize your work, or try to survive on the ship alone;

- Respond in time to malfunctions of your spacecraft and repel attacks
  from space invaders.

## Game session time

The game will be divided into levels, each of which will last 10-15
minutes. With each level, the difficulty will increase, and during
breaks, you can buy the necessary equipment and weapons. There will be 3
levels in total.

## Technical characteristics

Minimum system requirements for a PC:

Windows 10 64-bit, Quad Core 2.4 GHz, 8 GB RAM, GeForce GTX 1050;

Controls: keyboard and mouse, gamepad.

# **Gameplay**

The game starts on a spaceship that moves to the next checkpoint. There
are 3 checkpoints in total, including the final one. The main objective
of the game is to survive until the final point. The survival of the
characters will be facilitated by the condition of the ship, as well as
the working modules on it. During the journey, the ship will be shelled,
which can damage the hull and modules of the ship, the crew, and cause
fires (more details about the threats on the ship are described in
paragraph 2.3.1). In addition, the ship can be infiltrated by invaders
who also pose a threat to both the crew and the ship. Upon reaching the
end of the game, players receive a score that will depend on the amount
of money the team was able to save during the journey and the integrity
of the ship.

## Characterization of the characters

Game characters will have the following characteristics:

- HP - character health. When it drops to 0, the character dies, thus
  leaving the game completely, or if the game was played in co-op,
  another player can buy a new character in the store for a free player;

- Oxygen. While in a section with a fire or a hole, it will decrease
  (every 2 seconds per 1 unit). After the oxygen supply is exhausted, HP
  will begin to decrease (every 1 second by 1 unit), which can lead to
  death. If the character lowers the helmet visor of the suit, the
  oxygen will be consumed from it first.

- The speed of movement. It depends on the object held by the player.

- Combat Skills Level - affects the quality of the character in combat -
  additional damage from weapons, firing spread (barrel swing), throwing
  distance.

- The Engineer skill level affects the character\'s ability to repair
  complex electrical systems such as the reactor, engines, cooling
  system, oxygen supply system, autopilot system, generators, cameras,
  and surveillance system.

- Mechanics skill level - affects the character\'s ability to repair
  mechanical damage to the ship, such as holes, doors, and fires.

## Character classes

There are four classes of characters in the game: Officer, Mechanic,
Engineer, Captain. Each character has a skill level that corresponds to
their class:

In single player mode

|         | Mechanic skill level | Skill level of the Engineer | Level of combat skills | Health | Oxygen |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|--------|--------|
| Captain | 3                    | 3                           | 3                      | 200    | 200    |

In a co-op

|          | Mechanic skill level | Skill level of the Engineer | Level of combat skills | Health | Oxygen |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|--------|--------|
| Officer  | 1                    | 1                           | 3                      | 200    | 100    |
| Captain  | 2                    | 2                           | 2                      | 100    | 100    |
| Mechanic | 3                    | 1                           | 1                      | 100    | 200    |
| Engineer | 2                    | 3                           | 1                      | 100    | 100    |

## Mechanics

### Breakdowns

From time to time, sections of the ship will suffer damage. Damage can
be hull damage caused by fire, module failure, or the loss of an entire
compartment.

####  Damage to the body and doors {#damage-to-the-body-and-doors}

If the housing is damaged, the corresponding compartment loses oxygen.
If there are three or more damages in one compartment, the speed of
movement in it decreases.

If the door is damaged, it will not be possible to close it, which will
lead to the spread of oxygen-free air into the open compartments if the
adjacent compartments have holes in them.

####  Fire {#fire}

If critical failures are not repaired for a long time, a fire will
start. When a fire starts in a module, it will run out of oxygen and
will need to use its supply from the suit. If the fire continues, it can
spread to other compartments.

####  Module failure {#module-failure}

The ship\'s modules directly affect certain of its systems, so their
damage will affect the quality and performance of these systems. Each
module has two levels of failure - normal and critical (for the
specifics of failure, see the ship\'s compartments in which it is
located in paragraphs 2.5.1 - 2.5.9).

####  Loss of a compartment {#loss-of-a-compartment}

If a bay is lost, it cannot be recovered, and all modules in the bay are
lost. Some bays cannot be lost, while others cause an immediate defeat.
For the consequences for each bay, see Sections. 2.5.1 - 2.5.9.

###  Repair of ship systems {#repair-of-ship-systems}

To repair the damage, you need the appropriate items:

- damage to the body and doors are repaired with a welding machine (3
  seconds);

- fires are extinguished with a fire extinguisher (one second per fire
  unit);

- damaged modules are repaired with a soldering iron (normal - 4
  seconds, critical - 8 seconds).

To repair the damage, you need to find the location of the breakdown,
which will be highlighted by vfx effects, and direct a welding machine
at it if it is a hole in the case, or a soldering iron if it is damage
to the module. This reduces the charge of the corresponding tool.

If a player does not have the necessary equipment in his hands or does
not want to spend the charge of the appropriate equipment, he can use a
universal resource (blue duct tape) to repair any breakdown, but for a
very short time (10 seconds).

To put out a fire, you need to take a fire extinguisher and start
spraying the powder on the fire.

### Consumables

All consumables in the game can be divided into 3 categories:

1)  tool charges - soldering iron charges and welding machine charges.

2)  character consumables - first aid kits and oxygen cylinders;

3)  ammunition for weapons.

### Money. {#money.}

At the beginning of the game, players have a fixed amount of money. The
money is spent in stores, and the final outcome of the game depends on
it.

### Shop

The shop opens at the control points and is available near the dock. The
shop\'s products include the following(approximate):

| **Product.**                                    | **Price.** |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------|
| soldering iron charges                          | 15         |

## Ship

The ship is divided into sections that are connected by an airlock or
door. The main compartments of the ship include: deck, reactor section,
engine section, cooling section, storage, life support section,
generator room, hub, and dock. Most of these sections have modules that
can be damaged.

The general layout of the ship is as follows:

where P is the deck

R - reactor

E - engine section

O - cooling section

C - composition

K - life support section

G - generator

X - hub

DK - dockworker

B - landing compartment

###  Deck  {#deck}

The section on which the surveillance system for analyzing the ship\'s
condition and monitoring intrusions, tools for depressurizing parts of
the ship, and the autopilot system are located.

The surveillance system is presented in the form of images from the
cameras of each compartment. When a breakdown occurs in a compartment,
an indicator lights up near the corresponding camera. The details of the
breakdown can be viewed through the camera. In the event of a breakdown,
the cameras stop working, but the indicators work. In case of a critical
failure, both cameras and indicators do not work. Also, this compartment
cannot be lost.

The depressurization tool allows you to undock a box module so that the
consequences of its failure do not spread to other modules. If it
breaks, the undocking of the ship\'s modules will be slower. In case of
a critical breakdown, the captain will not be able to undock the ship\'s
modules

If the autopilot breaks down, the ship will start to receive hull
damage, i.e. holes, more often. Depending on the duration of the
breakdown, the frequency of holes will increase.

### Reactor section

This section will house the reactor that keeps the engine alive. If it
is damaged, a fire breaks out. When it is disabled, the corresponding
engine is shut down. If this section is lost, the section with the
corresponding engine is lost. If all reactors are lost, the game ends in
defeat.

### Engine section

A ship\'s engine directly affects its ship\'s performance. Damage to the
engine slows the ship down, and a critical failure will stop the ship
from moving. If the engine is lost, the ship\'s speed is halved. There
are two sections with engines on the ship. If two engines are lost, the
game ends in defeat.

### Cooling section

This section will house the reactor cooling systems. The ship has two
such sections, one for each reactor. In the event of a breakdown, the
reactors will overheat from time to time, which will cause their medium
breakdown. If the reactors are already overheated, it will cause
critical failure.

In the event of a critical breakdown or loss of this section, the
reactor will overheat even more often.

### Composition

A section with all the tools for repairing, consumables and weapons.

### Life support section

The section responsible for the oxygen supply on the ship. In the event
of a partial failure, oxygen disappears in all compartments of the ship,
except for the deck, the hub, and the life support section itself. In
the event of a critical failure or loss of a compartment, oxygen
disappears everywhere.

### Generator

A section with a generator that is responsible for lighting the ship. In
case of a breakdown, the light on the ship will start blinking, and in
case of a critical breakdown, it will turn off completely. If this
section is disconnected, the light on the ship will never return.

### Hub

A large main section of the ship. From here you can move on to other
sections.

### Docker

A small section of a ship designed to dock with other ships. This is
where invaders will get on board (in most cases). It is also used for
trading in stores. It cannot be depressurized.

### Landing compartment

It\'s just a compartment through which the team lands on the ground.

## Enemies

From time to time, enemies get on the ship. They are hostile to all
characters and will try to track and attack them. In addition, if
players hide in locked neighboring compartments, enemies may try to
break down the door, find a workaround, or simply break modules or the
ship.

1.  Space shrimp

It occurs at all levels. It enters the ship through holes. If there is
no one in the compartment, it starts breaking the ship\'s modules. It
has two attacks:

| Characteristics | Value (units)                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| KP              | 40                                           |
| Side attack     | 5                                            |
| Top-down attack | 3 + deceleration (-20% speed for 10 seconds) |

- side attack - the attack deals damage;

- top-down attack - the attack deals damage and slows down victims;

  1.  Space snail

He is met from the second level. It enters the ship through the dock. He
only breaks the door and heads towards the players.

| Characteristics | Value (units)                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| KP              | 400                                                 |
| Swing           | 10                                                  |
| For example.    | 8 + bleeding (1 damage every second for 10 seconds) |

- swing - the attack deals damage and knocks players back;

- napag - catches up with the target and jumps on it, causing bleeding.

  1.  Space scorpion

It is found on the third level. It enters the ship through the dock and
holes. If there are no players in the compartment, it breaks the modules
and then moves on to the neighboring compartments.

| Characteristics  | Value (units)                                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| KP               | 400                                             |
| Bite.            | 20                                              |
| Poisonous breath | poisonous cloud (2 damage every second, 10 sec) |
| Tail attack      | massive damage 40                               |
| Frantic attack   | 75                                              |

- bite - deals damage;

- Poisonous Breath - sprays a poisonous cloud that damages everyone in
  it. It disappears after 10 seconds.

- Tail attack - deals damage and throws players away;

- Frenzied attack - performed before death and deals enormous damage.
